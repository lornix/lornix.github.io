I'm going to try to document some of my findings and explorations, much of
which I probably have in a git repo somewhere.

Also have to figure out the markdown syntax for here.

__Basically__, I _should_ be able to `use` [GitHub][1] Flavored Markdown here now.

    Some code lines here
    let x=y*25;
    writeln("Argh! Pascal!");
    exit(0);

And then back to regular stuff.
